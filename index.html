            </ul>
            <p>
                So why another JavaScript visualization library?
                Charts can always be made with a template engine, by directly manipulating the DOM
                with the raw <a href="https://www.w3.org/DOM/">W3C DOM JavaScript API</a>, or by using a
                library such as <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>.
                But, we don't want to have to re-invent the wheel every time.
                The <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> (Data-Driven Documents) library is a powerful
                framework for DOM manipulation.  However, it is really best thought of as a
                toolbox, as it does not contain any built-in charts per-se.  You can use it to help create
                all sorts of custom visualizations, but there is a steep learning curve and lots of
                repitition required to recreate common charts.
                At a higher-level, there are a plethra of JavaScript visualization libraries availble
                with a wide range of built-in charts you can grab and start using off the shelf.
                For various projects I've tried to use them and generally ran into problems such as them
                requiring the data to be laid out in a certain way, or missing functionality I needed
                without a good way to extend them.  Out of this frustration, C3 was born.
            </p>
            <p>
                C3 is a collection of data visualizations leveraging the D3 toolbox.
                It provides these charts with a simple declarative API to easily get started.
                However, it does not bury the implementation in an abstraction layer that loses
                the major benefits of D3.
                Data sets can generally be provided as an array of objects, but no restriction is made on
                the format of the object.  Accessor functions can be defined to describe the shape and how
                to get what the chart needs from the data set, or to provide arbitrary logic to get the data
                from other locations.
                C3 relies on and exposes the raw CSS styles and DOM events to allow a lot of flexibility in
                styling and interactive behaviour.  Because it exposes raw styles and events it does
                not restrict the styling or events that your browser supports.  As new styles or events
                are offered by browser vendors they are automatically supported.
                If that's not enough, C3 also provides a mechanism for extending charts with
                new functionality if the built-in features are insufficient.

            <p>
                Check out the <a href="examples/">examples</a> as a tutorial of how to create some simple visualizations.
                Or, jump to the <a href="examples/?#worldbank">World Bank</a> example for a more complex
                scenario with multiple linked charts for a relational data set that can be dynamically
                filtered across multiple dimensions.  There is also an <a href="api.html">API overview</a>
                and <a href="doc">API reference</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that these documentation pages are bundeled with the source repository.
                Therefore, they are intentially kept simple barebones documentation and examples without
                pulling in too many additional dependencies to look pretty.

            <h1>Usage</h1>
            <p>
                To use C3, simply include <code>d3.js</code>, <code>c3.js</code>, <code>c3.css</code>,
                and any desired C3 visualizations.  For example:
                <blockquote><pre>
&lt;script src="d3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="c3.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="c3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="c3-table.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="c3-plot.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="c3-layers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="c3-legend.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="c3-polar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> is the only hard dependency for C3.
                Many thanks to Mike Bostok for creating this wonderful toolbox.
                Be sure to include the D3 script before including the C3 script.
            </p>
            <p>
                For additional performance, the <a href="http://square.github.io/crossfilter/">Crossfilter</a>
                library can also be included before C3 to improve some sorting operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                C3 is also bundeled with a TypeScript definitions file <code>c3.d.ts</code> for those who
                would like to use <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>.

            <h1>Compatibility</h1>
            <p>
                C3 has been tested with Chrome, IE, and Firefox.
                However, not all browsers fully support all features and so there may
                be some styling and placement differences.
                Performance is definitely best with Chrome.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notably, IE does not support canvas swimlanes embedded in an SVG chart,
                vector scaling for zoomable line charts, and
                placement of labels in the center of scatter plot circles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, please note that by default some IT departments set a policy which defaults IE to an old
                "compatibility" mode for internal sites where most things don't work.  Either each user has to disable
                this compatibility mode or you can add the following in your html header to request to disable
                compatibility mode:
                <blockquote><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" /&gt;</code></blockquote>
